# Practice Repo

This is a quick and dirty repository created exclusively to house all of my smaller practice projects in. All projects are organized by the month and year
they were created, and are maintained on GitHub for the purpose of transparency in my developmental growth, as well as getting accustomed to GitHub and how it
operates.
